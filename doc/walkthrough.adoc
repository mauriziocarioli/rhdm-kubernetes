== Installation

Set the environment variables
DEMO_DM_ADMIN_USR
DEMO_DM_ADMIN_PWD
to the Decision Manager admin credentials

Set the enviornment variables
DEMO_MAVEN_ID
DEMO_MAVEN_URL
DEMO_MAVEN_USR
DEMO_MAVEN_PWD
to the external Maven repository information

Edit dc/etc/default.conf and replace the [...] fields with the required GitHub credentials.

Run the install command for your system.

You can follow the containers logs with

[source,bash]
----
pod-logs $(dc/name)
pod-logs $(ds/name)
----

Once Decision Central has completed start up you can login to it at http://localhost:30000/

Deploy the post-commit script with

[source,bash]
----
kubectl cp dc/etc/post-commit $(dc/name):/opt/kie/data/git/hooks
----

In order to deploy Decision Central artifacts to the externam Maven repository
distribution management must be added to the pom.xml of a Decision Central project:

[source,XML]
----
  <distributionManagement>
    <repository>
        <id>${env.MAVEN_REPO_ID}</id>
        <url>${env.MAVEN_REPO_URL}</url>
      <layout>default</layout>
    </repository>
  </distributionManagement>
----

In order to have this added automatically to a new project one can create the project from a
suitable Maven archetype.

Clone the Maven archetype and deploy to the external Maven repository

[source,bash]
----
git clone git@github.com:mauriziocarioli/simple-dc-archetype.git
cd simple-dc-archetype
mvn clean deploy -DaltDeploymentRepository=$DEMO_MAVEN_ID::default::$DEMO_MAVEN_URL
----

Now follow these steps to add the archetype to Decision Central:
