= Red Hat Decision Manager on Kubernetes

This project is a simple demo of Red Hat Decision Manager
on Kubernetes.

It demonstrates the following capabilities:

* Decision Central authoring environment in a pod.
* Automated commit of edited asset to GitHub using githooks.
* Automated deployment of artifact to external Maven repository.
* Decision Server (kie-server) execution environment in another pod.
* Execution of artifact deployed to external Maven repository.

== Requirements

* Either Docker or podman.
* Minikube.

== Description of the project

The project has several scripts to simplify development and debugging.

* install-linux deployes Decision Manager to Minikube on Linux.
* install-macos deployes Decision Manager to Minikube on Mac OS.
* k8-start starts the Minikube cluster.
* k8-stop stops the Minikube cluster.
* k8-console ssh into the cluster node
* get-pods get the pods in the cluster
* nuke deletes the deployment

Further scripts and configurations are in the directories:

* dc - build and configure Decision Central image,
* ds - build and configure Decision Server image.

dc/Dockerfile and ds/Dockerfile are used to build custom images

Useful commands in each directory are:

* dc/name 
  prints the Decision Central pod name,
* pod-desc $(dc/name) 
  prints the Decision Central pod description,
* pod-console $(dc/name) 
  ssh into the Decision Central container,
* pod-shell $(dc/name) "command" 
  executes command in the Decision Central container,
* pod-log $(dc/name) 
  prints the Decision Central log.

The above works for the Decision Server replacing dc with ds.
